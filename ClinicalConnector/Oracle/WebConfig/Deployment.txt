Instructions for Installation Of the Clinical Connector Admin UI to the C3D Middle Tier

First Time Deployment Instructions:

 Database Object Enhancement
 ---------------------------
 1) Connect to SQL*Plus using the Userid and Password of the Clinical Connector Admin UI Owner. (C3PR)
 3) Once SQL*Plus is started, set your default directory by using the menu options
    "File / Open"
    Select the directory where the installtion files are located (step 1).
    Select the file "Install_CCAdminUI.sql"
    Select the "Open" button.
 4) The contents of the "Install_CCAdminUI.sql" file will be brought into Sql*plus.  

 5) Install -
    The installation of the Clinical Connector Admin UI can now begin. 
    Begin by typing the following at the SQL prompt:
    @Install_CCAdminUI.sql

    The script will execute
 6) Once the SQL prompt reappears, check the output file "Install_CCAdminUI.lst"
    for errors.
 7) Install the Data Extract Forms.

 Web Deployment
 --------------
 NOTE:  At the NCICB, a directory has been created on the Middle Tier Web Server 
 (the same machine where RDC and OPA are deplyed) that holds C3D Utilities and Applications.
 This directory is named "ncioraapps" (i.e. D:\ncioraapps).  A subdirectory "html" was also 
 created, to hold Utility specific launch web pages. (i.e. D:\ncioraapps\html).

 Using this set up mentioned above, the following steps can be used to deploy the 
 Clinical Connector Admin UI as a Web App.

 1) The Clinical Connector Admin UI form will need deployed to the C3D Application directory.

 	Copy the file:

	CCAdminUI.FMX

	to:

	D:\ncioraapps

 2) Next, the html landing page for the form needs deployed:

 	Copy the file:

	CCAdminUI.htm

	to:

	D:\opaapps45\html

 3) Next, the web configuration for the tool needs added to the web configuration file.
    Note, this is a ONE TIME edit.  If the tool has already been configured, do not add it again

 	edit the following file:

	d:\ORACLE\806\FORMS60\server\formsweb.cfg

	to the end of the file, cut-and-paste the contents of the file:

	Formsweb_cfg_CCAdminUI.TXT

 4) The Service "OracleiSuitesHTTPServer" will need to be restarted on the Middle Tier, to ensure 
    that the application is available.

 5) Once completed, the URL should be similar to:
    http://middle_tier_name/opa45/CCAdminUI.htm
    *Note: middle_tier_name should be the same as that used by the URL for RDC or OPA.
