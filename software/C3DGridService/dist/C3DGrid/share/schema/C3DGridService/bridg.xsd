The FDA then approves the submission based on compilation of all of the modules. These modules are reviewable units.

For example, a veterinary medicine New Animal Drug Application (NADA) is constructed from the Investigational New Animal Drug Application (INADA).

NOTE: The StudyProtocol class encapsulates the semantics of two 'views' of the single concept 'study.'  The name 'StudyProtocol' was chosen to both disambiguate the somewhat overloaded term 'protocol,' as well as to emphasize that the class has two important relationships to the Documentation class, each of which emphasizes a different aspect of the overall semantics of the StudyProtocol class:
1). StudyProtocol is a sub-class of the Documentation class:
StudyProtocol is a sub-class of Documentation and, as such, inherits all of the basic characteristics of its parent.  In particular, an instance can contain all of the definitions, specifications, and content of the various (logical) documents which collectively define a study, including (but not limited to) documents that describe the objective(s), background, and/or plan (including the design, methodology, statistical considerations, organization, or other supplemental materials that describe the required information of a Study.
2). StudyProtocol is a collector for Documentation instances:
StudyProtocol is a collector for all of various artifacts (including the protocol itself) which collectively define a study, including (but not limited to) specifications of planned, scheduled, or performed Activities, ObservationResults, Assessments, Analyses and their various inter-relationships.

NOTE:  A StudyProtocol can be either Primary or Correlative.  A StudyProtocol is considered to be Primary if it has one or more Correlative studies associated with it.  A Correlative study extends the objectives or observations/conclusions of a Primary study, enrolling the same (or a subset of the same) subjects as were enrolled in the Primary study. (Correlative Studies are not modeled in BRIDG yet.)

NOTE: We are assuming that a document is a container, which may be physical or logical, with the six characteristics listed in the definition of the Document class.  This class is the container for the Plan. 

NOTE: StudyProtocol describes the pre-study, study, and post-study portions of the plan.</xs:documentation>

These approaches may include medicines, vitamins, vaccines, minerals, or lifestyle changes. Diagnostic trials are conducted to find better tests or procedures for diagnosing a particular disease or condition. Screening trials test the best way to detect certain diseases or health conditions.

NOTE: Clinical trials are generally categorized into four (sometimes five) phases described separately herein. An investigational medicine or product may be evaluated in two or more phases simultaneously in different trials, and some trials may overlap two different phases. 
Phase 1: The initial introduction of an investigational new drug into humans. Phase 1 studies are typically closely monitored and may be conducted in patients or normal volunteer subjects.  
Phase 2: Controlled clinical studies conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication or indications in patients with the disease or condition under study and to determine the common short-term side effects and risks associated with the drug.
Phase 3: Studies are expanded controlled and uncontrolled trials. They are performed after preliminary evidence suggesting effectiveness of the drug has been obtained, and are intended to gather the additional information about effectiveness and safety that is needed to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide an adequate basis for physician labeling. 
Phase 3b: Phase 3b studies are a sub category of phase 3 trials near the time of approval to elicit additional findings.
Phase 4:  Concurrent with marketing approval, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) may seek agreement from the sponsor to conduct certain post-marketing (phase 4) studies to delineate additional information about the drug's risks, benefits, and optimal use. 
Phase 5: Post-marketing surveillance is sometimes referred to as Phase 5.</xs:documentation>

An observation is an act of recognizing and noting a fact or an occurrence of an event of interest. An observation may involve examination, interviews, or measurement with devices.  Observations are not intended to alter the state of the subject. 

An assessment is a process by which an interested party (or parties) arrives at a judgment as to whether an observation is relevant based on asserting a temporal, spatial, or causal relationship between the observation and some other factor.
 
An interested party is an individual or group with the authority and/or expertise to assess the relevance of an observation (e.g., investigators, health care providers, subjects).

This class is an abstract concept that contains attributes common to all types of study documents. 

For example, in the Regulated Product Submission (RPS) Model , regulatory processes require the submission of documents from the Applicant to the Regulatory Authority. These documents are varied in focus and are often defined by the field of study or by the regulatory application requirements of the region or Regulatory Authority (e.g., Integrated Summary of Safety, Pharmacokinetics Written Summary). </xs:documentation>

For example,  an identifier assigned by some organization in the context of a study, for example, sponsor protocol number, national number, cooperative group protocol number, CDISC protocol identifying number. 

For example, in the Regulated Product Submission (RPS) message, this identifies the file (with a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)), which is part of the documentation. A URI is a compact string of characters used to identify or name a resource. The main purpose of this identification is to enable interaction with representations of the resource over a network, typically the World Wide Web, using specific protocols. URIs are defined in schemes defining a specific syntax and associated protocols.</xs:documentation>

For example, over time, there may be multiple changes to a documentation, and the revision allows an individual to capture relationships between changes in the instances of a documentation over time. There can be a new revision every time the content changes. 

For example, in RPS this could be operationalized as follows: The version number would be an integer starting at '1' and incrementing by 1. The first instance or original report should always be valued as '1'. The version number value must be incremented by one when a report is replaced, but can also be incremented more often to meet local requirements.

Subtypes/keywords can also be defined in other coding systems. In those cases a subtype/keyword would not have to be created, the logical document would point directly to the other coding system.

For example, species, indication, manufacturer, biocompatibility, facility, drug substance, drug product. Each one of these are associated with a type code. </xs:documentation>

Each clinic visit is a Subject Study Encounter, and the 24-hour period during which the Holter monitor records data is another Subject Study Contact.  The Holter monitoring SSE overlaps with the first clinic visit SSE and may overlap with the second clinic visit SSE.

NOTE: Subject StudyEncounters are nested within each other.  </xs:documentation>

			<xs:documentation>A study cell is associated with a particular arm and epoch.  It describes that portion of a particular arm (a planned path through the study) which describes, for a particular epoch (study state), what activities the subject will be involved in.  The design of a study can be visualized as a cell in a matrix whose columns are epochs and whose rows are arms; each cell of such a matrix is a study cell. A study cell contains one or more StudySegment instances, which serve to describe a part of a particular arm during a particular epoch.

For example, in a crossover trial with two treatment epochs and three arms, there are six "treatment" study cells, one for each of the 2 treatment epochs in each of the 3 arms.</xs:documentation>

For example, during the second treatment epoch of a study, Arms A and B are still blinded and Arm C is no longer blinded. So, Arm A and B must have identical blindedDescriptions.

For example, in a study with 3 arms, Arm 1: standard vaccine given in three shots at 2 months, 5 months, and 12 months of age; Arm 2: new vaccine given in three shots at 2 months, 5 months, and 12 months of age; Arm 3: new vaccine given in two shots at at 2 months and 5 months of age.
Subjects assigned to the third arm are unblinded at some point during 5 months and 12 months. By the time of the Third Shot Epoch, the "Arm 3/Third Shot" Study Cell can be called by this, its unblinded name.  However, the "Arm 1/Third Shot" and "Arm2/Third Shot" Study Cells still need blinded names.

Each Epoch serves a purpose in the trial as a whole, typically exposing the subject to a treatment or preparing them for a treatment, or gathering post-treatment data.  Epoch-specific (state) transition rules control the subject's movement from one Epoch to another.

For example, a trial designed to assess the effects of treatments might have 3 epochs, a Screening epoch in which subjects' eligibility is determined and baseline measurements are made, a Treatment epoch during which treatments are given and effects of treatment are assessed, and a Follow-up epoch during which post-treatment assessments are conducted.
