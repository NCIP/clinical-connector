This chapter explains what software you must install on the Windows server before installing the caBIG{~}^®^~ Clinical Connector.

This chapter includes the following topics.
{toc:minLevel=3}

h3. Clinical Connector Baseline Software Requirements

|| Requirement || Version || Component || Link ||
|| Java SE | 1.5.0_10 SDK | Apps, webSSO | [http://java.sun.com/products/archive/] ||
|| Ant | 1.7 | Installation | [http://archive.apache.org/dist/ant/binaries/] ||
|| Tomcat | 5.5.27 | Apps, webSSO | [https://gforge.nci.nih.gov/svnroot/commonlibrary/trunk/techstack/approved-exception/apache-tomcat-5.5.27.zip] ||
|| caGrid | 1.3 | caBIG Integration Hub | [http://gforge.nci.nih.gov/frs/download.php/7813/caGrid-installer-1.3.zip] ||
|| Oracle Client | 8.0.6 | Oracle Client run-time libraries and tools | The client software should be available from the Oracle DBA or System Group that installed C3D ||

h3. Step 1: Download caBIG{~}^®^~ Clinical Trials Suite 2.2

The Suite distribution consists of multiple parts. The parts can be downloaded using the following URLs.
* \[\]
* \[\]
* \[\]

Once downloaded, the parts should be unzipped to the same root folder.  Please verify that the sizes of the downloaded files are same as on the Gforge upload site [http://gforge.nci.nih.gov/frs/?group_id=615]. When all parts are unzipped, the root folder contains:
|| Directory/File || Description ||
| readme.txt | Includes information on what is included in the bundle. |
| suite-installer | Exploded Suite installer for caBIG Integration Hub, caBIG Adverse Event Reporting System (caAERS), caBIG Central Clinical Patient Registry (C3PR), caBIG Patient Study Calendar (PSC), and caBIG LabViewer applications |
| clinical_connector | Zipped installer for the Clinical Connector. |
| cagrid | Contains the caGrid 1.3 installer and documentation |
The /cagrid directory contains the necessary files for installing caGrid 1.3. The caGrid installer can be used to install most of the required software for the Clinical Connector.

h3. Step 2: Use caGrid to Install Software Components

{info:title=JAVA_HOME Warning}
Ensure the environment variable JAVA_HOME is set to the correct value before proceeding with caGrid installation.  A missing or incorrect JAVA_HOME will result in errors during the process.

# Locate the caGrid 1.3 Installer in the /cagrid directory created during the unzipping of the Suite. The Installer should be contained in the file *caGrid-installer-1.3.0.1zip*.
# Unzip the file *caGrid-installer-1.3.0.1zip*. This creates the directory *caGrid-installer-1.3*. This documentation refers to this directory as *CAGRID_INSTALLER_LOCATION*.
# From a command prompt, launch the installer using the following command:
{noformat}
 C:\> cd CAGRID_INSTALLER_LOCATION
 C:\CAGRID_INSTALL_LOCATION> java -jar caGrid-installer-1.3.jar
{noformat}
