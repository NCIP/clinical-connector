== Tool Overview ==

[[Image:Clinical Connector Diagram small.jpg|400px|right]]The Clinical Connector provides a semantically integrated service layer via caGRID that allows C3D adopters to expose functions within C3D (Oracle Clinical). The exposed service layer uses a BRIDG based model and defines service operations that could be implemented by other CTMS systems. The first service allows external applications to load laboratory test result data into C3D study structures for registered patients. The second service allows external applications to enroll patients onto a C3D hosted study. Exposing additional C3D functionality is being planned.
