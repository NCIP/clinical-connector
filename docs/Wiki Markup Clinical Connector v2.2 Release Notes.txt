Key enhancements include:
* Clinical Connector Service methods have been divided into two separate groups to distinguish between general Clinical Services and specific C3D Services.&nbsp; They are divided as follows:
** Clinical Connector Services
*** Load Labs
*** RegisterSubject
** C3D Grid Services
*** Get Study CDEs
*** Get Study CDE Data
*** Is Valid Study
* Clinical Connector Services have been enhanced to use the BRIDG 2.1 data model.&nbsp; Additionally, the Clinical Connector service incorporates JAXB serialization to support specific ISO data types that could not be performed under Axis based serialization
* Suite Level Security for (CSM Authorization) implemented.
* Public/Private Study designation supported for Get Study CDE Data Service.
* Redaction of Private data elements implemented for Get Study CDE Data Service.
* JSP for collecting C3D User Ids and associating them to Grid Ids.&nbsp; This is being implemented to support C3D Study Level &nbsp;security for “Private” studies.
* The following data elements from the Subject Registration message are now being loaded to C3D CRF based on the CDE Id / Version loading mechanism:
** Patient Consent Signed Date
** Patient Initials
** Patient Birth Date
** Patient Gender
** Patient Registration Date
* The following data elements are no longer loaded to C3D:
** Patient Last Name
** Patient First Name

* Patient Id (MRN) that are not numeric will need additional processing by the AutoLoader in order for it to be loaded in the CDMS.
* Studies designed using multiple occurrences of a data element (CDE Id) within the study will cause the data to not load.
** This is a known limitation of the DCAPIs, due to the need for addition context data that is not provided via the Patient
* Registration Service.Patient data will not load to data collection instruments (DCI) within C3D where there exists a mandatory data element on the DCI.
